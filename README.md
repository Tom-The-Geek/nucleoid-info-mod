# Nucleoid Info Mod
Shows the list of open games on a convenient _(slightly silly)_ icon.

The icon only shows when the server ip is `nucleoid.xyz` or `play.nucleoid.xyz`

## Credits
Not sure who made it, but the icon (nuclethonk) is taken from the emoji on [the official Discord](https://nucleoid.xyz/discord/)
